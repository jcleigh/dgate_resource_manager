## Detailed File Format Specifications

### Image Files (.PIC, .SCR)

Death Gate uses a custom image format optimized for 256-color VGA graphics:

#### Format Structure
```
Header (varies by version):
- Width (2 bytes)
- Height (2 bytes) 
- Compression flags (2 bytes)
- Palette information (variable)

Pixel Data:
- Run-length encoded (RLE) pixel data
- 8-bit color indices
- Delta compression for animations
```

#### Key Image Files
| File | Purpose | Typical Size |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `DGLOGO.SCR` | Death Gate logo | 320x200 |
| `TITLE.SCR` | Title screen | 320x200 |
| `DGATE000.PIC` - `DGATE086.PIC` | Game scenes, backgrounds | 320x200 |
| `ITEMS.SCR` | Inventory interface | Variable |
| `MOUSE.SCR` | Mouse cursor graphics | Small |

#### Color Palettes
- 256-color palettes (768 bytes: 256 × 3 RGB values)
- Often embedded in image files or stored separately
- Different palettes for different game areas/moods

### Animation Files (.FLI, .FLC)

Death Gate uses the **FLIC** animation format, developed by Autodesk:

#### FLIC Format Details
```
FLIC Header:
- File size (4 bytes)
- Magic number (2 bytes): 0xAF11 (.FLI) or 0xAF12 (.FLC)
- Frames count (2 bytes)
- Width, Height (2 bytes each)
- Speed (2 bytes) - milliseconds between frames
```

#### Animation Categories
| Type | Files | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Character Animations** | `BALTAZAR.FLI`, `ZIFNAB.FLI` | Character-specific scenes |
| **Location Intros** | `ARIANUS.FLI`, `PRYAN.FLI` | World introduction sequences |
| **Cutscenes** | `INTRO.FLC`, `ENDING.FLC` | Opening/closing cinematics |
| **Special Effects** | `GLOWFIN.FLI`, `NECROMAC.FLI` | Magical effects and transitions |

#### Technical Characteristics
- **Frame Rate**: Variable, typically 10-20 FPS
- **Resolution**: Usually 320x200, some smaller for effects
- **Compression**: Delta compression between frames
- **Color**: 256-color palette-based

### Audio Files

#### XMIDI Format (.XMI)
Death Gate uses **Extended MIDI** for background music:

```
XMIDI Header:
- "FORM" chunk identifier
- Chunk size
- "XMID" format identifier
- Subchunks containing:
  - MIDI data
  - Timing information  
  - Controller data
  - Loop points
```

**Features:**
- Enhanced timing precision over standard MIDI
- Loop point markers for seamless background music
- Additional controller data for richer sound
- Compatible with General MIDI sound sets

#### WAV Audio (.WAV)
Standard PCM audio for voice acting and sound effects:
- **Sample Rate**: Typically 22.05 kHz
- **Bit Depth**: 8-bit or 16-bit
- **Channels**: Usually mono for voice, stereo for music
- **Compression**: Often uncompressed PCM

### Text and Data Files (.DAT, .TXT)

Death Gate uses sophisticated compression for text resources:

#### String File Format
```
Text Header (6 bytes):
- String count (2 bytes) - Number of text strings
- Stream size (2 bytes) - Size of compressed data
- Flags (2 bytes) - Compression version and options

Compressed Data:
- Huffman-encoded text
- Dictionary-based compression
- Version-specific algorithms
```

#### Compression Versions
Death Gate text files use several compression algorithms:

**Version 2**: Basic Huffman compression
- Static dictionary
- Simple bit-level encoding
- Used in earlier Legend Entertainment games

**Version 3**: Enhanced compression
- Dynamic dictionaries
- Improved compression ratios
- Context-sensitive encoding

**Version 4**: Advanced compression  
- Most sophisticated algorithm
- Used in later Legend Entertainment titles
- Complex bit-stream processing

#### String File Examples

| `DGATEXSTR.DAT` | Game dialog and narrative | Version 3 |
| `DGATEITEMS.DAT` | Item descriptions | Version 2 |
| `DGATEHELP.DAT` | Help text and hints | Version 3 |

## Resource Interaction Patterns

### Dynamic Loading
Death Gate employs sophisticated resource management:

1. **On-Demand Loading**: Resources loaded as needed to conserve memory
2. **Palette Switching**: Different areas use different color palettes
3. **Audio Streaming**: Music transitions smoothly between locations
4. **Animation Layering**: Multiple animation layers for complex scenes

### File Dependencies
Many resources are interconnected:
- Images require corresponding palette files
- Animations may reference external sound files
- Text resources link to audio for voice acting
- Scene files coordinate multiple resource types

### Memory Management
Given 1994 hardware constraints:
- **RAM Usage**: Optimized for 4-8 MB systems
- **Disk Access**: Minimized through clever caching
- **Compression**: Aggressive compression to fit on floppy disks
- **Streaming**: Audio and animation streaming techniques

## Historical Context

### Legend Entertainment's Technology
Death Gate represents Legend Entertainment's technical achievements:

- **Adventure Game Engine**: Sophisticated scripting system
- **Multimedia Integration**: Seamless blend of graphics, audio, and text
- **Cross-Platform Design**: Originally DOS, later Windows adaptations
- **Accessibility Features**: Text alternatives for audio content

### File Format Evolution
These formats influenced later Legend Entertainment games:
- Gateway 2 (1992) - established baseline formats
- Eric the Unready (1993) - refined compression
- **Death Gate (1994) - peak implementation**
- Mission Critical (1995) - enhanced multimedia
- Callahan's Crosstime Saloon (1997) - final iteration

### Preservation Challenges
Modern preservation efforts face several challenges:

1. **Format Documentation**: Limited official specification documents
2. **Platform Dependencies**: DOS-specific file handling
3. **Compression Complexity**: Sophisticated algorithms require careful reverse engineering
4. **Hardware Dependencies**: MIDI sound requires appropriate sound fonts
5. **Legal Considerations**: Copyright restrictions on game assets
